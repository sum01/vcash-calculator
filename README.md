# Vcash Mining Calculator

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/sum01/vcash-calculator/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/sum01/vcash-calculator/commits/master)

A simple calculator that takes some input and calculates your estimated profit, average mined, and power cost for each day/week/month/year.

All pricing info is pulled from the [public Bittrex API](https://www.bittrex.com/Home/Api), and network information is pulled from [xCore's Vcash explorer API.](https://explorer.vcash.info/info)

Note: The current network hashrate can change quickly, and calculations depend on it, so results may vary.
